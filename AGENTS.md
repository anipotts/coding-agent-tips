# coding agent tips

this repository is an opinionated, source backed handbook for people who know basic coding and are learning to work with agents. codex and claude code are coequal primary guides. archived claude code plugins remain available only for the compatibility window documented in `content/archive/claude-code-tools.md`.

## public standard

- assume basic coding knowledge and little agent experience. give a brief, optional crash course with embedded primary references. explain unfamiliar agent terms where they matter and let fluent readers move straight to practical material.
- use short headings that help readers find a question, worry, or curiosity. preserve clear topic names and Ani's adopted headings. personal judgments require his words; a question heading does not establish his experience.
- separate tested behavior, official product facts, analysis, and open questions.
- prefer primary sources and record them in `editorial/sources.json`.
- do not use generated activity, commit frequency, or vendor benchmarks as evidence of quality.
- keep the voice direct, lowercase, and professional. avoid hype, fan language, and unsupported authority claims.
- treat Ani's submitted wording and manual browser edits as the primary voice reference. preserve his phrasing unless accuracy, safety, or clarity requires a change, and explain that conflict instead of silently polishing it away.
- write like a personal, engaging handbook built from curiosity and use: concrete experiences, recognizable details, honest uncertainty, and a clear reason for caring. avoid generic authority language and an overly technical textbook voice.
- do not use mid-dot dividers in public copy or interface labels.
- never use litotes or negative comparison frames in public copy. state the intended claim directly.
- repeat context only when it changes understanding or supports a deliberate editorial rhythm. remove labels that restate the title, route, or surrounding section.
- preserve compatibility paths through 2026-11-05. archive changes are limited to security, data loss, and installation blockers.

## canonical ownership

- `design.md` owns public visual, interaction, responsive, media presentation, and progressive agent-native design standards.
- `content/home.md` owns the homepage.
- `content/handbook/*.md` owns guidance shared across products.
- `content/guides/<product>*.md` owns product overviews and chapters.
- `content/archive/*.md` owns frozen compatibility material.
- `editorial/sources.json` owns source metadata, current product versions, and evidence definitions.
- `src/site.ts` owns shared navigation and interface copy.
- components render canonical metadata. they do not own guide summaries, product explanations, recommendations, or versions.
- run `bun run sync:readme` after changing a principal guide title or evidence label. the generated README blocks must match before validation passes.
- edit public prose in its canonical Markdown file and review the affected route in the normal Astro development server.
- normal public prose does not use hyphens. preserve them only for syntax, routes, filenames, commands, URLs, version identifiers, and official product names.

## verification

run the source, Astro, generated route, Markdown, and shell checks before publishing a broad change. run `bun test plugins/cc/tests` and `pytest plugins/lore/tests` when archive files or shared runtime dependencies change, and during the scheduled full verification.

- protected pull requests must use a committer identity GitHub recognizes. local cryptographic verification is supporting evidence; GitHub's `verified=true` result is the merge gate.
- use `--body-file` for GitHub pull request or release text that contains Markdown code spans or shell syntax. never pass that content through an inline shell argument.
- use the package scripts for Astro development, editing, checks, builds, and previews. they invoke Astro through Node so a restarted shell does not need Bun on `PATH` for those commands.

## review

evaluate factual support, taxonomy, safety, maintenance cost, and whether the recommendation follows from the evidence. do not optimize prose for engagement at the expense of precision.
